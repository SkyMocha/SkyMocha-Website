            <p>
                5895 or Peddie Robotics is The Peddie School's FRC team.
                <br><br>
                I participated my sophomore, junior, and senior years.

            <h3>2020 Season</h3>
            <p>
                2020 was my frist FIRST season. 
                Our build season was uninterupted by COVID, and although we consistently fell behind schedule, we produced one of our districts best robots.
                <br><br>
                As no one on the team was familiar with wiring and pneumatics, our mentor Mr. Meredith taught me the ropes, and I was the person most in charge of wiring the robot electrically and pneumatically.
                During our first competition I was on call in case the wiring broke, but it never did. 
                <br><br>
                We won our first competion, almost guarenteeing us a trip to district championships, and possibly even world championships in Detroit.
                <br><br>
                Sadly, due to COVID, none of this happened.

            <h3>2021 Season</h3>
            <p>
                The 2021 season was lackluster due to COVID.
                <br><br>
                Our team was split across the world, so those of us who were at Peddie worked on creating a simple swerve bot. 
                This season was mostly just to train new people, and also keep older poeple from losing their learned experience.
                <br><br>
                I taught some of the new students wiring, and also began learning how to drive Emperor Goose for fun.

            <h3>2022 Season</h3>
            <p>
                TBD
                <br>
                I will continue on the engineering subteam, remain lead of electrical, and most likely be scout lead for competitions.
