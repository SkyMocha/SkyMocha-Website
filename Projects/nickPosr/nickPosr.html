For my beginner project after MNIST, I would create a msuic generation program. The first step, and ultimately my last, would be to convert audio into image. In the end, a MIDI file would be converted to a CSV file, which would therefore be converted into a image displaying the data of the CSV. (CSV & Img on the right) The image could then be reverse-engineered back into a MIDI file, with minor flaws. (Major flaws throughout the process can be found on the right) <br>The flaw with this approach, however, is that songs would range between a few hundred lines and a few thousand lines. Not only is the variablity tough for AI to handle, but for longer songs, the amount of inputs would exceed anything that could compute them at my disposal. <br>In the end, it was a scraped project, yet served as my first forray into data science rather than Artificial Intelligence. </h5></div>
