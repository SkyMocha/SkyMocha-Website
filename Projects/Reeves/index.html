                My school has two yearly speech competetions, a monologue competition, and a written speech competition.
                I knew most people would look within themselves and find a deep and meaningfull topic to convey to an audiance whether to win the competition, or to spread a message.
                I took this oppourtunity to look within myself, and write a speech about my love life.
                Although I won nothing for this speech, I did get a lot of laughs and a standing ovation.
