            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The Peddie School has two yearly speech competetions, a monologue competition (The Declemation), and a written speech competition (Geiger Reeves).
                I participated two times, once in my freshmen year, and another in my Junior year.

            <h3>Freshmen Reeevs - The Courage To Ask</h3>
            <p>
                I knew most people would look within themselves and find a deep and meaningfull topic to convey to an audiance whether to win the competition, or to spread a message.
                I took this oppourtunity to look within myself, and write a speech about my love life.
                Although I won nothing for this speech, I won crowd favorite, recieving weeks of congratulations, and a standing ovation.

            <h3>Junior Reeevs - I'm weird and so are you</h3>
            <p>
                My junior year I strived to have some balance between light-heartnedness and an important message.
                Therefore, I talked about something that many high-school students struggle with: being considered "weird".
                This speech "I'm weird and so are you" is a speech centered around celebrating weirdness.
                Due to COVID the speeches were not delivered on stage, but recorded in video.
                For this speech I recieved honorable mention out of approx. 30 competitors.
