            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="left">
                This project consists of three questions explored over a months-long time-period. 
                It consists of a primary video essay, followed a few months later by a well-researched paper,
                and finally by a follow-up video essay covering the topic in the most depth. <br><br>
                Questions:<br>
                1. Do Trans Women Disproportionately Go Into CS? <br>
                2. Why Do Trans Women Disproportionately Go Into CS? <br>
                3. So, Why Don't Cis Women?

            <h3>The Original Video</h3>
            <p>
                My first real video essay titled "Why The Trans Programmer?" would be the beginning of an odyssey exploring this question.

            <h3>Paper</h3>
            <p class="left">
                Through online anecdotal evidence and online communities, there is an in-group idea of trans people (specifically trans-feminine individuals) disproportionately entering computer science education & fields. Existing data suggests this is a plausible trend, yet no research has been done into exactly why. As computer science education (traditional schooling or self-taught methods) is integral to working in computer science fields, a simple research survey was conducted to gather data on 138 trans people’s experiences with computer science & computer science education. This article’s purpose is to shed insight on the motivations for trans individuals choosing computer science paths, while acting as a basis and call to action for further research.

            <h3> The Better Video </h3>
            <p class="left">
                As of finshing the paper on the topic, I began work on a complementary video exploring this topic in even further depth.<br>
                <br>
                A release date of late March is expected.
