                During the 2019-2020 school year, my schools Computer Science club began planning an in-person Hackathon; held in our schools science center, 
                we would invite all participants from the surrounding schools to gether on these two floors to create.
                However, amidst a global pandemic, we decided to make it an online Hackathon from August 22nd to August 23rd, 2020.
                The Hackathon was primarily hosted over Discord, where I was a communicator, as well as administrator and organizer. 
                <br>
                Day one was primarily the opening, and things went smoothly as it was primarily the opening ceremony and brainstorming for teams; however, as the end approached on day two things got hectic very quickly leading to a 15 hour work day.
                During the second day I was tasked at the start (9 AM) to lead a game session, and later throughout the day was tasked on things such as checking in with teams, creating a judging schedule, making announcements, and more.
                The greatest challenge was organizing the judging; as judging was supposed to be approximately 3 to 4 hours, but ended up lasting almost 7 full hours. 
                I was for the majority of those 7 hours constantly adjusting the schedule to accomodate teams and help judges.
                <br> 
                In the end I only survived thanks to lots of caffeine.
