            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                PeddieHacks is a yearly hackathon hosted by The Peddie School. 
                The Hackathon started shortly before COVID, so for its first two years it has been online.

            <h3>PeddieHacks 2020</h3>
            <p>
                During the 2019-2020 school year, my schools Computer Science club began planning an in-person Hackathon; held in our schools science center, 
                we would invite all participants from the surrounding schools to gether on these two floors to create.
                However, amidst a global pandemic, we decided to make it an online Hackathon from August 22nd to August 23rd, 2020.
                The Hackathon was primarily hosted over Discord, where I was a communicator, as well as administrator and organizer. 
                <br><br>
                Day one was primarily the opening, and things went smoothly as it was primarily the opening ceremony and brainstorming for teams; however, as the end approached on day two things got hectic very quickly leading to a 15 hour work day.
                During the second day I was tasked at the start (9 AM) to lead a game session, and later throughout the day was tasked on things such as checking in with teams, creating a judging schedule, making announcements, and more.
                The greatest challenge was organizing the judging; as judging was supposed to be approximately 3 to 4 hours, but ended up lasting almost 7 full hours. 
                I was for the majority of those 7 hours constantly adjusting the schedule to accomodate teams and help judges.
                <br><br>
                In the end I only survived thanks to lots of caffeine.

            <h3>Peddie Hacks 2021</h3>
            <p>
                For 2021 Peddie Hacks, I took a more backseat approach to the organization. 
                After the hell that was 2020, I wanted a more relaxing experience. 
                However, I did serve during the orginazation process by making suggestions by attending the organization zoom meetings. 
                Most of my suggestions served to help create the judging criteria.
                <br><br>
                During the actual competition, my biggest roles were once again being the MC and organizing the Discord server.
                I updated the 2020 PeddieHacks <a href="https://github.com/SkyMocha/PeddieHacks_Bot" target="blank">Discord bot</a>, documented it, and put it on GitHub for future students to use. 
                This was vital in organizing teams, giving them rooms to work, and checking in with them. 
                <br><br>
                When it came to being master of ceremonies, I ran the latter half of the opening cermonies, and the entire closing cermonies.
                I definitiely did not do my best during the closing ceremonies. I was given the slides three minutes before go time, so I made a lot of mistakes, but cold reading is my specialty.
