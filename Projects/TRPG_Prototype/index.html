                This un-named prototype is something I started working on at the end of sophomore year.
                Enfatuated with the idea of turn-based strategy games, I decided to go down a route taking inspiration from games such as Divinity Original Sin, Xcom, and Shadowrun.

                This game would have used pixel art, primarily sprites that are 16x16, as art was not my primary focus.
                Through this I was able to learn pixel art more in depth, something that can be very useful in the game-dev world.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, I learned a few things through this project such as A* pathfinding, and a deeper look into the Unity game engine.
                In this prototype I was able to include a map generator from png images (which I was planning on modifying in the future), random enemy spawning and clustering, A* pathfinding, game states, and many other minor features!
                The next step in this game would be to create AI logic for the enemies, as a system for AI already exists.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the process of game development, I recorded two videos detailing my progress, as well as did a live-stream where I did some pixel art.
