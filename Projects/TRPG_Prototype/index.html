            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This un-named prototype is something I started working on at the end of sophomore year.
                Enfatuated with the idea of turn-based strategy games, I decided to go down a route taking inspiration from games such as Divinity Original Sin, Xcom, and Shadowrun. 
                <br><br>
                This game would have used pixel art, primarily sprites that are 16x16, as art was not my primary focus.
                Through this I was able to learn pixel art more in depth, something that can be very useful in the game-dev world.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, I learned a few things through this project such as A* pathfinding, and a deeper look into the Unity game engine.
                In this prototype I was able to include a map generator from png images (which I was planning on modifying in the future), random enemy spawning and clustering, A* pathfinding, game states, and many other minor features!
                The next step in this game would be to create AI logic for the enemies, as a system for AI already exists.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the process of game development, I recorded two videos detailing my progress, as well as did a live-stream where I did some pixel art.
