            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                My first term of Sophomore Year I was tasked with a open-ended project using a Raspberry Pi. 
                The final result is a remote for a speaker. 
                The program runs a Python (Flask) backend, connected to a web-page remote, containing a music visualizer, as well as a way to choose the currently playing song. 
                <br><br>The remote is paired to a Raspberry Pi connected to a custom-built speaker,
                made of 2 sheets of Balsa wood, with Dayton Audio exciters connected in parallel. 
                <br><br>
                The original intent of the project was to hook up LEDs to the piece of Balsa Wood, and CAD & Laser Print a mount for the speaker.
                The LEDs would light up as a music visualizer depending on the song being played, and the mount would be attatched to the wall and help for better audio.
                In the end, I did not get that far. I created a mount in CAD but never finalized and created it, and although I had a partial music visualizer in software, it was not good enough for LED hookup.
                <br><br>At the end of the term, I was asked to give a presentation on the project, which can be seen on the right.
