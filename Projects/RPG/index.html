              After my Ludum Dare 45 game, I concluded that for me, the best game I can make single-handedly is a game with next to no, or no graphics. 
              Therefore, a text-adventure game would be the most likely bet, as it leverages my strengths: programming & writing. 
              I decided to set out with the same theme as my Ludum Dare Game: you see nothing. 
              There are caveats in the game, making long-term continuation of it difficult, for the writing I did was highly unorganizd. 
              However, through the writing, I figured out what this kind of game would need. <br>
              I used LibGDX, a Java game framework, to build my own text-based game engine. This included text stages, towns, buildings, fights, and NPC encounters with a variety of possible options for each encounter. 
              I held development on the game not due to limitations with the programming aspects, or creation of the game engine, but writing for long stretches for NPCs, scenarios, dungeons, and more became tedious. 
              Future forrays into games after this became more technical, my next substantial work being a contributor to OddFolk, a ASCII Open-world Rouge-like built in Java.
              Later, I would come back to this style of game, with a more organized approach.</h5>
