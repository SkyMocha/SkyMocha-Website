            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Although FuzzBot was my first Discord bot, 
                at the time I did not have the knowledge to make it what I envisoned it to be, a bot that could easily provide customizable reaction images. 
                FuzzBots original purpose, was to make reacting to peoples messages with an image far easier.
                For example, if someone said "oh worm?" a common phrase in a server I was in, a drawing made by a friend would show up in response.
                Now with far more knowledge in coding, I was able to make RXNS, a bot that provides customizable server-based reactions.
                RXNS does this through a custom website that feeds off of the Discord API, the RXNS API that I built, and a MongoDB database.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p> 
                Over the span of a few weeks I built up RXNS and continued modifying it until it was ready for production.
                Once done, and after a few weeks of waiting, 
                RXNS was approved on <a href="https://top.gg/bot/688388524528893955" target="blank">top.gg</a> and instantly gained a small following of 40, then 60, then 80 servers.
                By the end of its life-span, RXNS had around 60 servers, throughout recieving small updates to the web dashboard, and back-end.
