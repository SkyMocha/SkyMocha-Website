Therefore, a text-adventure game would be the most likely bet, as it leverages my strengths: programming & writing. <br> I decided to set out with the same theme as my Ludum Dare Game: you see nothing. There are caveats in the game, making long-term continuation of it difficult, for the writing I did was highly unorganizd. However, through the writing, I figured out what this kind of game would need. I used LibGDX, a Java game framework, to build my own text-based game engine. This included text stages, towns, buildings, fights, and NPC encounters with a variety of possible options for each encounter. I held development on the game not due to limitations with the programming aspects, or creation of the game engine, but writing for long stretches for NPCs, scenarios, dungeons, and more became tedious. <br> Future forrays into games after this became more technical, my next substantial work being a contributor to OddFolk, a ASCII Open-world Rouge-like built in Java. Later, I would come back to this style of game, with a more organized approach.",

For OddFolk, having worked on a primative dialogue loading system in Java with my extra experience, I realized there were many more ways to create a dialogue system than the one I created for the first iteration of this game. <br> Instead of Java & LibGDX, Godot & GDScript were used to create a more polished feel, and an easier time creating and poritng the game to different platforms. A system in GDScript that would read .txt files and compile them into a game that could be played. As a result of this modularity, only a haldful of maybe 2-3 files of code are used, and only a few hundred lines, rather than the copy and paste amalgomation that was the previous iteration of this game. <br> This system is also far easier to use, making the only road-block in the creation of the game to be the writing aspect. However, I set forth on this game with an idea in mind, and although a vague idea, its an idea that Im fond of and would like to pursue further."]

To make them UwU text, the easiest way of doing so would be to write a Python script that would turn all XML files text (not the tags or important information) into UwU text. The only down-side to this, and the only thing I would correct in the future, is that these XML files are core to the game. Therefore, when the game is updated with any form of changes to the XML, the mod will break. So, the currently existing mod only works for one version of the game. <br> C#/Harmony: All other text, such as message logs, are constructed within the code of the game. There is no 'pre-determined' way of changing the text, so it has to be changed during run-time in the C# code. The issue with this, though, is during run-time, methods cannot be directly modified. The way modders and the way I got around this is by using a library called Harmony. Harmony allows the modder to create prefixes / suffixes for methods, meaning that code can be executed before or after the methods initial code. So, say a method called addLog(Message) adds to the message log in Caves of Qud using a variable called Message. All I have to do as the modder is modify the Message variable into UwU text by adding a prefix to the addLog(Message) method.

The Hackathon started shortly before COVID, so for its first two years it has been online.", "**<Peddie Hacks 2022>** During the 2019-2020 school year, my schools Computer Science club began planning an in-person Hackathon; held in our schools science center, we would invite all participants from the surrounding schools to gether on these two floors to create. However, amidst a global pandemic, we decided to make it an online Hackathon from August 22nd to August 23rd, 2020. The Hackathon was primarily hosted over Discord, where I was a communicator, as well as administrator and organizer. <br> Day one was primarily the opening, and things went smoothly as it was primarily the opening ceremony and brainstorming for teams; however, as the end approached on day two things got hectic very quickly leading to a 15 hour work day. During the second day I was tasked at the start (9 AM) to lead a game session, and later throughout the day was tasked on things such as checking in with teams, creating a judging schedule, making announcements, and more. The greatest challenge was organizing the judging; as judging was supposed to be approximately 3 to 4 hours, but ended up lasting almost 7 full hours. I was for the majority of those 7 hours constantly adjusting the schedule to accomodate teams and help judges. <br> In the end I only survived thanks to lots of caffeine.", "img>https://skymocha.net/Projects/PeddieHacks/assets/PHacks_Judging_Schedule.jpg PeddieHacks 2020 Judging Schedule: Built with black magic, caffeine, sleep deprevation, and hard work."],

However, I did serve during the orginazation process by making suggestions by attending the organization zoom meetings. Most of my suggestions served to help create the judging criteria.<br> During the actual competition, my biggest roles were once again being the MC and organizing the Discord server. I updated the 2020 PeddieHacks Discord bot, documented it, and put it on GitHub for future students to use. This was vital in organizing teams, giving them rooms to work, and checking in with them.<br>When it came to being master of ceremonies, I ran the latter half of the opening cermonies, and the entire closing cermonies. I definitiely did not do my best during the closing ceremonies. I was given the slides three minutes before go time, so I made a lot of mistakes, but cold reading is my specialty.", "**<PeddieHacks 2022>** For the 2022 hackathon, I choose to keep contributions to the project minimal, as my summer was primarily geared towards getting ready for college. I did a few bits of maintenance on the Peddie Hacks Discord bot, but that was more or less the extent of what I did.", "url>https://www.peddie.org/about-us/stories/stories-detail/~board/news/post/peddiehacks-challenges-participants-to-code-a-better-world(Peddie Hacks 2021 Blog Post) url>https://peddiehacks.peddie.org/(Peddie Hacks Website) url>https://github.com/SkyMocha/PeddieHacks_Bot(Peddie Hacks Discord Bot)","img>https://skymocha.net/Projects/PeddieHacks/assets/Organizers2021.jpg 2021 Lead Organizers"]
