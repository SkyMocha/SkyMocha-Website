Programming, Discord Bots, Discord.js, Starter Guide|
April 5, 2020|
I’ve always considered making a Discord bot to be one of the best ways to start or strengthen your knowledge of programming. With the ability to learn everything from the foundation of an if statement up to API calls and databases, there's a lot of room for growth. However, not many people know where to start with Discord bots.|
I believe the best way to start with Discord bots is YouTube tutorials! I say this as someone who’s made a number of Discord.js YouTube tutorials. However, where it becomes an issue, is that a lot of people go into these tutorials without knowing any programming. This is why I’m making this article. I believe that to make a Discord bot one must know the fundamentals of code before beginning.|
If that's not for you, there are other methods of obtaining your own Discord bot, mostly paying someone else to create one. Yet if you do want to get into programming, then keep reading.|
For a while I’ve used W3 schools to learn specific things from Python, to Javascript, to CSS and HTML. Because of this, I’d recommend them if you just want to know the bare minimum to create a Discord bot. I once made a check list of all one would realistically need to know to start and it isn’t much.|
The articles you'd need to go through, in order, are:|
Output, Statements, Syntax, Comments, Variables, Operators, Arithmetic, Data Types, Functions, Objects, Strings, String Methods, Number Methods, Arrays, Math, Random, Booleans, Comparisons, Conditions|
You can find all of these on <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/js/ target=blank> w3schools </a>. However, if you wish to have a more fundamental and solid understanding of programming, I suggest taking a course. You could always take a physical course whether that be at school or at a camp, but that is not always an option. Although there aren’t many “courses” I’ve found that explain things well or proficiently on YouTube for free, there is one I’d recommend for two different programming languages. If you are learning Java, whether that be for fun or for class, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28 target=blank>TheNewBoston</a> has absolutely amazing tutorials. On the other hand, I’ve been striving in my free time to create a concise yet informative set of programming tutorials in Python mixed with a little bit of Java at <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_toOuxdjJk&list=PLAr8NYOzRYC1U3yIylVuBTZznXcdLUExX target=blank>NickStudios</a>.|
Some other resources I believe are helpful specifically for Discord.js are:|
<a href=https://discordjs.guide/ target=blank>discordjs.guide</a>
and the <a href=https://discord.js.org/#/ target=blank>official documentation</a>|
I genuinely believe that making a Discord bot is one of the best starting projects someone can do! It's simple, yet lends way for a lot of creativity and expansion. It’s well documented both with YouTube tutorials and also documentation. However, I’ve seen on my own Discord server way too many people stumble into the pitfall of not learning the fundamentals of code before making a bot. When I’m helping people out, the questions of “what is logging?” and “what is undefined?” and “what is an if statement?” plague my nightmares. So, make a Discord bot! Just know a little bit first. I hope this guide has served as a decent jumping off point to making your own, unique, Discord bot.
