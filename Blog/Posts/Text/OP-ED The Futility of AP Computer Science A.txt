During my 9th grade year in school I took AP Computer Science A. Although not explicitly an AP course in my school, we did learn the curriculum and eventually took the exam. Yet, what I’m about to say is likely what most students feel once they have started really programming: there is no purpose in the Computer Science A exam. Rather, I should say that the Computer Science A exam is what my teacher said it would be: a Java exam.|
Recently I was helping a friend who was going through the same process I went through in 9th grade, and as I looked through the questions she was being asked I told her one thing. What she was learning was pointless. The AP exam asks questions that are specifically geared around the nooks and intricacies of Java. Even as someone who’s used Java to make rudimentary game engines I’ve never come across the need to use most of what the AP CS exam had taught me. What she was learning wouldn’t be useful in the real world. I do believe certain practice-sites like <a href=https://codingbat.com/java target=blank>Codingbat</a> have a place in the real world, as they teach you how to quickly problem-solve when you need to create functions for x, y, or z reasons. Yet, the questions of Computer Science A, <i>especially</i> the multiple choice section (I do not have as much of a problem with the free response questions) are a major discrepancy from what I believe people my age should be learning.|
Programming as I’ve learned is something you learn from practice and experience. It's a skill, so it would make sense that like all other skills you need to hone it. I would see why Computer Science as a subject would work in the format of an AP exam, but not specifically programming. I knew this going into computer science classes, as I already had programming experience under my belt. What I found out was that everything I learned during that year to train for the exam is all easily self-teachable with resources on the internet. Resources on YouTube such as <a href=http://www.youtube.com/c/NickStudiosCode target=blank>mine</a>, or even more mainstream sources such as <a href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ target=blank>GeeksForGeeks</a> and <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/ target=blank>w3schools</a> are plentiful. Not to mention the exorbitant amount of help available to beginners through Discord servers or StackOverFlow.  Because it's not the learning of programming that’s so difficult, it's sometimes the practice.|
Am I saying computer science classes shouldn’t exist? Absolutely not. I think like any other skill, computer science as a class should be offered to HighSchoolers. I just feel the approach the College board is taking with AP Computer Science is one that just leaves people frustrated and having wasted a lot of time. I know for a fact, that even after the exam, most of what I really learned had been self-taught. I continued Computer Science in school, and now as I'm nearing the end of my sophomore year I’ve realized something. Learning to work with other students in my class, and bouncing ideas off teachers and other students who have different skill-sets is what computer science class is really about. Computer Science isn’t something that can be taught at you, it’s something that needs to be practiced and honed through project-based learning.|
That's what self-teaching myself computer science has taught me about the CS curriculum in HighSchool. It’s something that deserves to be largely project-based with input from teachers or more experienced students. And this is what I believe the College Boards AP Computer Science A should reflect.
